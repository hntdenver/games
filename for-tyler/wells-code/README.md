Use command prompt on windows and terminal on mac, go to the directory where you have the python file, then type python ```wells.py``` and it will execute the code.

If you've cloned this repo directly into your user directory, you can open your command terminal and enter the command ```cd``` followed by the command ```ls```. Cd takes you to your root directory, and ls shows you the contents within it. After entering ```ls``` you should see the folder you cloned the repo into, ie. ```~/user/games```<br><br>
Enter the command cd ```games/for-tyler/wells-code``` to enter this directory, you can enter the comman ```ls``` once more to make sure you see ```wells.py``` and ```goggles.txt```. If you do, just enter the command ```Python3 wells.py``` and it will run the code that prints an ASCII image of Wells!
