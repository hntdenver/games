<h1>The Secret Wells Code</h1>

Use command prompt on windows and terminal on mac, go to the directory where you have the python file, then type python ```wells.py``` and it will execute the code.

**For Mac**<br><br>
If you've cloned this repo directly into your user directory, you can open your command terminal and enter the command ```cd``` followed by the command ```ls```. Cd takes you to your root directory, and ls shows you the contents within it. After entering ```ls``` you should see the folder you cloned the repo into, ie. ```~/user/games```<br><br>
Enter the command cd ```games/for-tyler/wells-code/py``` to enter this directory, you can enter the comman ```ls``` once more to make sure you see ```wells.py``` and ```goggles.txt```. If you do, just enter the command ```Python3 wells.py``` and it will run the code that prints an ASCII image of Wells!
<br><br>
Same steps for the other ```.py``` files in the folder, run them and see what happens!

**For Windows**<br><br>
With python installed using the instructions on their website, you should be able to enter the commands ```pip3 install homebrew```, ```pip3 install nodejs```, and ```pip3 install httpserver``` in order to install the required modules. The ```ls``` command will not show folder contents, and ```http-server``` will need to be entered with out a hyphen, ```httpserver```.
